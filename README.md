ðŸŒ¿ SPECIAL EPD Database Management Project


Project Overview

The SPECIAL EPD (European Pollen Database) Project focused on the integration, quality control, and standardization of environmental and palaeoclimate data.
This work supports accurate vegetation and climate reconstructions across Europe, the Middle East, and western Eurasia.


Technologies Used

Python: Data cleaning, automation scripts

SQL: Database management and querying

Excel: Initial data compilation and harmonization

Pangaea / Public Repositories: Data source integration


Project Objectives

Data Compilation: Merge pollen records from multiple public repositories and original author contributions.

Taxonomic Standardization: Harmonize taxonomic names at genus and species levels.


Quality Assurance:

Error corrections on taxon names, ages, coordinates (latitude, longitude, elevation).

Recalibration of radiocarbon ages using INTCAL2020.

Validation and correction of pollen counts, depths, and sample completeness.

Database Expansion: Increase database size from ~1576 sites to ~1758 entities.

Bayesian Age Modeling: Developed new age models to improve chronological precision.


Key Achievements

Increased database reliability by recalibrating 1,598 radiocarbon-dated entities.

Automated data validation processes, reducing manual QA effort by ~30%.

Integrated and standardized a vast dataset into three structured levels:

Clean tables

Intermediate tables

Amalgamated tables


How to Use

Note: This dataset is primarily academic. Access is available through PANGAEA and DOI-linked repositories.

Clone this repository.

Access sample scripts for data validation and pollen count amalgamation.

Review database structure documentation to integrate with new analysis workflows.
